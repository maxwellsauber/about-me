## About Me
My name is Max Sauber. I am a web designer with a bunch of front-end development experience. 
Over the past 10+ years I have held positions including Web Development Associate, Sr. Web Designer, and Web Development Manager.
My roles in the insurance industry have limited opportunities to keep up with, experiment with, and deploy the latest industry trends - Something i hope to remedy with this bootcamp.
